## About the Project

The "System Real Estate Financing" project is a Java application designed to provide an interactive tool for simulating property financing. The simulator covers three main types of financing: house, apartment, and land. Using the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm, the project leverages core concepts. The system architecture is based on creating classes that represent each type of financing, with a generic base class and specific derived classes for houses, apartments, and land. Additionally, the simulator includes data persistence through file serialization, ensuring that simulation information can be stored and retrieved persistently. This feature enables users to save and load their simulations for future reference, providing greater flexibility and continuity in using the tool.
